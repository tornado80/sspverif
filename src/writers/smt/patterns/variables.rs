/*
 *
 * old:
 * We want to abstract over
 * - system state variables (__self_state, __global_state)
 * - package state vars
 * - package params
 * - local variables
 *
 *
 * It must be possible to use a variables without having to specify it's sort.
 * This means the type/sort must be part of the "spec", not the regular value.
 *
 * We also want to be able to get the name of a variable, as a string.
 *
 *   Problem: not all variables have names -- e.g. pkg state vars only exist inside the package state
 *   and we use accessors to get to them.
 *
 *      Solution 1: Skip cases like this and concentrate on locals and system state vars
 *
 *          Feels half-assed, but also does solve the only real issues of scope pollution and
 *          getting the variable names as strings
 *
 *      Solution 2: Solve these problems in a subtrait and keep the main trait more general
 *
 *          I guess this is more "clean", but begs the question of why to formalize it this way.
 *          Do we really need to? If not, Solution 1 seems better
 *
 *      Solution 3: Change how package state and param variables are accessed and just bind them
 *                  into the local state, so they all are variables on SMT-level, too
 *
 *          This seems to require a lot of changes with little benefit.
 *
 *
 *   Conclusion: I think I'll go with Solition 1 for now. If we find the need to also have a pattern for
 *               package state and params, we can add that as a separate trait, and maybe make the
 *               VariablePattern a subtrait of that.
 *
 * new:
 * We want to abstract over SMT-level variables, i.e.
 * - system state variables (__self_state, __global_state)
 * - local variables
 *
